# Quick-Sort
Quick Sort is a data sorting algorithm that adopts a "divide and conquer" approach. Here is a brief explanation of how Quick Sort works:

1. Pivot Selection:
    Quick Sort selects an element from the data as a pivot.
    This pivot will divide the data into two parts: elements smaller than the pivot and elements larger than the pivot.
2. Recursion:
    The splitting process is performed recursively on both parts of the data.
    The data continues to be split until it is fully sorted.
3. Recombination:
    Once the splitting is complete, the smaller and larger elements are recombined.
    The final result is sorted data.

This project is a group assignment, and we create this code without using the built-in functions of python or creating our own functions.
